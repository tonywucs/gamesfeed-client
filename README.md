## Lessons Learned

Never underestimate the front-end aspect of a project. Also the front-end can go so far as the content that is available. In the process of completing this capstone there were quite a few components which required new fields of data from my database. Iterating through essential features and applying those changes through both the front and backends was a fun experience.


## Roadmap

- Increased UI customization options
- Discord integration to ping servers for updated news
- Add communities feature to post relevant articles for a group of friends or members
- Add the ability to comment on news articles
